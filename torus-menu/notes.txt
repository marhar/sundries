animate by moving around torus,
or by moving torus

modes

rectangle

cylinder, horizontal

cylinder, vertical

torus

twisted torus

sliced torus

twisted, sliced torus

--

twisted cylinder - no different than regular cylinder coz it doesn't connect

sliced cylinder - like a helix?

? is a twisted, sliced torus turnable, i.e. put on its side
and reversing the twisting and slicing ?


windows, behaves like sliced horizontal cylinder

mac, behaves like a rectangle

----

handling partial final column


for m x n rectangle, it is possible that the last column
is partially filled.

represent by m x (n-1) + b, where b is the number
of rows in the partial column.


-----

given len L, height H, width W
should be able to perform all calculations
with present position p0, next postion p1

---

diagonal

should apply to diagonals as well,
travel to any parts of the shape?


given p0, dx, dy, can still compute p1

(dx,dy) =

(-1, 1) ( 0, 1) ( 1, 1)
(-1, 0) ( 0, 0) ( 1, 0)
(-1,-1) ( 0,-1) ( 1,-1)
